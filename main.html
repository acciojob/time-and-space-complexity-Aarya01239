	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the efficiency of an algorithm by analyzing how its runtime grows with input size. Efficient algorithms exhibit favorable time complexity, executing tasks within acceptable time limits regardless of input scale.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm consumes relative to the input size, denoted by O(n) where 'n' represents the input size. It measures the maximum amount of memory required at any point during the algorithm's execution.</p>
